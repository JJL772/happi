HAPPI - Heuristic Access to Positions of Photon Instruments
===========================================================

Background
^^^^^^^^^^

Happi is a database-backed library that was originally created to hold
information about devices along SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source beamline.
Though initially purpose-built, happi provides a framework for general indexing
of devices or *things* that correspond to Python objects.

Happi will help you create and index your objects, search through them, and
provide relevant metadata based on the object type.
